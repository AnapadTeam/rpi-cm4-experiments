# LRA Haptics Java Test

This project is similar the [ForceSensingHapticsTest STM32-Experiments project](https://github.com/AnapadTeam/STM32-Experiments/tree/main/Projects/ForceSensingHapticsTest), but uses Java instead of C and experiments with the LRAs from NFP Motor instead of the ERM motor from Adafruit.
